Who doesn't want to know what places they've been to in the past? As a record of their travels or bits of their life. Too many details of travelling are easily forgotten, so this project is designed to record people's life track data by designing a piece of what I call `Footprint Card`, and subsequently visualize the track through a webpage, hoping to recall some forgotten travel memories. This coursework approaches this problem using Soft Systems Methodology (SSM).
