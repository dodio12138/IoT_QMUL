title: Conclusion
---

This project designs a prototype for recording and storing user location information, also called footprint card. The solution is designed using SSM methodology and covers both location recording and data transfer with knowledge of GPS, Bluetooth and other aspects. The board has also been selected so that it is small enough and easy to carry around, while taking into account the range. The prototype can now record the base movement and can store as well as transfer data. The solution design will be expanded again with UI, PCB and backup.
